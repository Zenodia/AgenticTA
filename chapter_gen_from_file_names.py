Key strategies include maintaining a three-second following distance, regularly checking mirrors in a systematic pattern, and adjusting speed for conditions to avoid ,speed blindness, It details proper positioning for turns (right edge for right turns, center for lefts) and highlights dangers of overtaking and abrupt maneuvers. Technical aspects cover reaction/braking distance calculations, the impact of kinetic energy in crashes, and using roadside reflectors (spaced 50m apart) for distance judgment. The text also addresses parking restrictions, hard shoulder usage, and the importance of avoiding left turns without clear visibility. Overall, it stresses defensive driving techniques to counter higher speeds and reduced friction on rural roads."

It emphasizes heightened risks at night, including reduced visibility (e.g., dark-clothed pedestrians seen only at 25-30 meters with low beams) and statistics showing 2-3x higher accident rates. Key practices include strategic use of headlights (high beams for maximum visibility, low beams to avoid dazzling others), positioning vehicles closer to the center-left lane, and adjusting speed to account for reaction distances. Special guidance addresses fog/snowstorms white wall effect, wildlife risks during dawn/dusk months, and legal lighting requirements (e.g., fog lights, parking lights). The text also highlights the importance of reflectors, avoiding distractions from oncoming headlights, and proper lighting combinations for different scenarios."
